### Fawkes is a Spigot/Bukkit plugin written in 100% Clojure.

#### This is a work in progress.

Requires Spigot 1.8-R0.1-SNAPSHOT (the new stuff from 12/2014), WorldEdit 6.0, WorldGuard 6.0, a MongoDB database, and BetonQuest.

It's an RPG in a box.  Sort of.  I'm in the process of cleaning it up.

To run it, you need to make a *one character patch* to the clojure 1.6.0 sources.  There's a patchfile in the project root for it.


This fawkes.
